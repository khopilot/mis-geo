# MIS Geospatial Platform - Theme Settings

## Current Default Theme: Light Mode

The application is now configured to use **Light Mode** as the default theme.

### What Changed:

1. **Default Theme State**: 
   - Changed from `isDark = true` to `isDark = false`
   - Light mode now loads by default when users first visit

2. **Default Map Style**: 
   - Changed from `'dark-matter'` to `'positron'` (light theme)
   - Map now shows with light colors by default

3. **HTML Root Class**: 
   - Removed hardcoded `dark` class from HTML element
   - Theme now properly responds to user preference

4. **Loading Screen**: 
   - Updated to use light colors (gray-50 background, gray-900 text)
   - Consistent with the default light theme

### User Theme Toggle:

- Users can still toggle between light and dark modes using the sun/moon icon in the header
- Theme preference is maintained during the session
- Both themes are fully supported throughout the application

### Available Map Themes:

Light Themes:
- ☀️ **Light Theme (Positron)** - Default
- 🗺️ Street Map

Dark Themes:
- 🌙 Dark Theme (Dark Matter)

Neutral:
- 🏔️ Terrain
- 🛰️ Satellite

### CSS Classes:

The app uses Tailwind's dark mode classes:
- Light mode: Default classes (e.g., `bg-white`, `text-gray-900`)
- Dark mode: Dark variants (e.g., `dark:bg-gray-800`, `dark:text-gray-100`)

### Future Enhancements:

To persist user theme preference across sessions, consider:
1. Using localStorage to save preference
2. Using cookies for server-side rendering
3. Detecting system theme preference with `prefers-color-scheme`
